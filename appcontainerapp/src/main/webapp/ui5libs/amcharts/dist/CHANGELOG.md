# amCharts 5 Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Please note, that this project, while following numbering syntax, it DOES NOT
adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) rules.

## [5.1.13] - 2022-04-15

### Added
- `useLastColorForLegendMarker` setting added to `BaseColumnSeries` (applicable to all column-based series like `ColumnSeries`, `CandlestickSeries`)
- `geodataNames` setting added to `MapSeries`. Allows setting translations to map features, e.g. countries. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/charts/map-chart/map-translations/).
- Read-only private setting `gridInterval` added to `DateAxis`.

### Fixed
- If geoJSON contained multipolygons with just one polygon, hovering over polygon was resulting in a JS error.
- `DateAxis` displayed wrong time when time was switching to DST, when a timezone was set on a `Root` element. 


## [5.1.12] - 2022-04-07

### Fixed
- Rounding a Date during daylight saving hour could produce incorrect result in some specific cases.


## [5.1.11] - 2022-04-06

### Added
- `groupDataWithOriginals` and `groupDataCallback` settings added to `XYSeries`. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/charts/xy-chart/axes/date-axis/#Custom_aggregation_functions).
- `strictMinMaxSelection` setting added to `ValueAxis`. When set to `true`, the axis won't round `min` and `max` of a selection to the nearest round values, but will use actual min and max (`extraMin` and `extraMax` will still be added if set). This is a good feature when your series displays not actual but derivative values, like `valueYChangeSelection` as it helps to avoid frequent jumping of series to adjusted min and max of the axis.

### Changed
- Internal layout of `XYChart` containers was changed. `plotContainers` now goes to `yAxesAndPlotContainer`, and `plotContainer` and `topPlotContainer` goe into `plotContainers`.

### Fixed
- If `XYChart` was used without animated theme, and scrollbar's background was clicked to zoom to some specific spot, it resulted in scrollbar not being updated anymore when zoomed with wheel or zoom-out button.
- Fixed and issue where nodes of `ForceDirected` series were flickering to 0,0 point when div of a chart was resized.
- Fixed potential XSS injection issue with the accessibility of tooltips.
- `container` setting in `ExportingMenu` was being ignored.
- In some specific cases not all series were included in min/max calculation of a `ValueAxis` resulting not all series to be visible.
- When whole series was out of selected scope, its last or first value (depending on seleciton) was still included when calculating min and max.
- Layouts were allocating space for margins of hidden items.


## [5.1.10] - 2022-03-30

### Added
- New in-line text formatting property `verticalAlign` added. Currently supports only `"super"` and `"sub"` values. E.g. `Copyright[fontSize: 8px; verticalAlign: super;]TM[\]`.

### Changed
- Logarithmic scale on `ValueAxis` was revamped with a different approach. No changes from the configration, but might influence appearance/scale.
- When calculating derivative values for series, `low`, `high`, and `open` used previous `low`, `high`, and `open` values. Now they all use `value` instead.
- Updated to D3 v7.

### Fixed
- In some cases, using a text placehodler, an empty string was shown insteaf of a zero.
- Some grid container masking issues fixed.
- Sometimes `valueAxis` was zoomed-in a bit on the first render of an `XYChart`.
- Axis ranges with `dRadius > 0` were not visible on `RadarChart`.
- Dynamic change of `value*Show` fields of an `XYSeries` was not working.
- Removing data from a legend could lead to JS errors in some particular cases.
- Ghost label was creating a gap in an `XYChartScrollbar` between scrollbar bottom an scrollbar series.


## [5.1.9] - 2022-03-17

### Fixed
- Fixed the issue with resizing a chart inside of a flexbox. ([Issue 311](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts5/issues/311))
- Fixed jumpy axis when panning an `XYChart` with mouse wheel.
- Panning XYChart with mouse wheel had incorrect direction if axis was inversed.
- If axis range had a gradient fill, gradient used to spread only through visible area, making it look icorrect.
- After pinch zooming and `XYChart` or zooming the chart with no animated theme used, CPU usage used to increase.
- `DateAxis` with `baseIntervals` `timeUnit` set to `"month"` could show incorrect month in the axis tooltip.
- If a `Graphics` had a gradient `fill`/`stroke` and initially was invisible, setting it to visible did not make the gradient to appear.
- While zooming `LineSeries`, a part of the line to the left of the first visible data point could disappear.


## [5.1.8] - 2022-03-10

### Added
- Settings `pinchZoomX` and `pinchZoomY` (defaults: `false`) added to `XYChart`. If set to `true` will allow pinch-zooming of a chart on touch devices. NOTE: these settings are not supported on `RadarChart`.
- `topPlotContainer` added to `XYChart`. It's a `Container` that can be used to place element over plot area.

### Changed
- The types for adapters has been changed to be more intuitive and useful. ([Issue 312](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts5/issues/312))
- Tapping an element on a touch device will now generate `pointerover` event in addition to `click`. When tapped somewhere else, `pointerout` event will be triggered.

### Fixed
- Fixing ES6 module detection by BundlePhobia again ([Issue 294](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts5/issues/294)).
- Pinch-zooming of a `MapChart` was not working well in some cases.
- `maxHeight` setting in `Sprite` was not working.
- Change of `minWidth` was not being applied at once, only if some other changes triggered chart to be redrawn.
- Changing or not setting data on an existing `FlowChart` was resulting in a JS error.
- `maxPanOut` setting in `MapChart` was not working.


## [5.1.7] - 2022-02-28

### Fixed
- Grouping to periods where `timeUnit` was `"day"` and `count > 1` was not working properly.
- When tooltips of multiple series were pointing at the same point, series order was not being respected (FF only).
- If a scrollbar was added before axes, scrolling series could result series to be out of sync with bullets.
- Tweaked `nb_NO` locale to better correspond to Norwegian Bokm√•l date formats.


## [5.1.6] - 2022-02-23

### Fixed
- Totals were not calculated until some interaction with `XYChart` chart if data was grouped initially.
- When tooltips of multiple series were pointing at the same point, series order was not being respected.
- Reverting "Fixing ES6 module detection by BundlePhobia" from 5.1.5 which was causing issues.


## [5.1.5] - 2022-02-22

### Added
- `minSize` setting added to `Flow` (`Chord` and `Sankey`) series. It's a relative value to the sum of all values in the series. If set, this relative value will be used for small-value nodes when calculating their size. For example, if it's set to `0.01`, small nodes will be sized like their value is 1% of the total sum of all values in series.

### Changed
- Direction of vertical panning with mouse wheel in an `XYChart` was inverted to make it consistent with OS native scrolling direction.

### Fixed
- Fixing ES6 module detection by BundlePhobia ([Issue 294](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts5/issues/294)).
- Parsing of dates using `"i"` format was not working properly when no milliseconds were supplied.
- Using `minZoomCount` and `maxZoomCount` on a `GaplessDateAxis` was not working properly.
- Sometimes vertical `XYChart` scrollbar was not reacting to chart's pan via mouse drag or wheel.
- Using mouse wheel on a chart that was setup to pan was also zooming in/out in addition to pan.
- In some cases grid on `GaplessDateAxis` was not being placed properly. Grid and Label placement improved.
- `ForceDirectedTree` could freeze when used with Animated theme in some cases.
- Changing of baseInterval on DateAxis was not properly working in some cases.
- In some cases, when no animated theme was used, a state on a Sprite was not applied.
- Setting data on `MapSeries` after `geoJSON` was updated was not working properly which resulted heat rules not to be applied.
- It was difficult to make a selection close to the start/end of plot area on `RadarChart`.
- When `XYChart` was fully zoomed in, using mouse wheel would start panning the chart instead of zoom.


## [5.1.4] - 2022-02-11

### Added
- `affectsMinMax` added to value axis range.
- `segments` property added to `Line` class. Allows passing multiple segments instead of continous line.
- `tooltipIntervalOffset` setting added to `DateAxis`. If not set, axis' tooltip will use value of the `-tooltipLocation` (cell start timestamp by default), so that tooltip would should rounded value, like 06:00 instead of 06:30 when interval is hourly. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/charts/xy-chart/axes/date-axis/#Axis_tooltip).
- `tooltipDateFormats` setting added to `DateAxis`. Allows specifying axis' tooltip date formats for time each time unit, different from `dateFormats`. NOTE: `tooltipDateFormat` will override the format if set. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/charts/xy-chart/axes/date-axis/#Axis_tooltip).
- `syncWith` setting added to `XYCursor`. Set it to an array of other `XYCursor` objects to automatically position them as the cursor moves. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/charts/xy-chart/cursor/#syncing-cursors).

### Changed
- Default tooltip date formats have changed slightly for `DateAxis`. Previously, it was using formats from `dateFormats`. Now it uses defaults/user values from newly-introduced `tooltipDateFormats` setting.

### Fixed
- In some cases `DurationAxis` with "second" as its base duration was going to stack overflow.
- Background on a `ValueAxis` was not showing.
- Improved performance for charts with lots of stacked series with null.
- Fixing mouse position when using `transform: scale` or `zoom` ([Issue 258](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts5/issues/258)).
- Some touch interactions were not working in iOS 12.


## [5.1.3] - 2022-02-03

### Added
- Added second parameter to `Root` constructor which contains settings object. For now, there's only one setting: `useSafeResolution` (default: `true`). [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/getting-started/root-element/#settings).

### Fixed
- Dynamic data updates on `MapPolygonSeries` were not working in some cases.


## [5.1.2] - 2022-02-01

### Added
- `"x!"` and `"y!"` options added to `XYCursor`'s `snapToSeriesBy` setting. Setting it to `"y!"` will make cursor will choose the nearest data point to snap to by measuring only
vertical distance and looking at the data items which are at the current X axis position (date or category). The same applies for `"x!"`.
- `tooltipDataItem` setting added to `XYSeries`. It's a read-only reference to a data item which series tooltip currently uses.

### Fixed
- `LineSeries` legend markers' stroke was not using series' color if `series.appear()` was called after series was initialized.
- `LineSeries` legend marker wasn't working properly if legend was using different `Root` element.
- Better disposing of `<canvas>` elements to work around iOS Safari GC bug.


## [5.1.1] - 2022-01-31

### Added
- New method `remove(key)` on Template's adapaters.
- Each chart-type package now exports its default theme as `DefaultTheme`. E.g. `am5xy.DefaultTheme`, `am5flow.DefaultTheme`, etc.
- TypeScript: Settings interfaces for all objects are now being exposed via bundled re-export files like `index.ts`, `xy.ts`, etc.
- New class `am5.Modal`.
- New `Container` setting: `reverseChildren`. If set to `true`, will start rendering from the last child, effectively flipping the order in how children of the cotainer are laid out. Useful for [right-to-left setups](
https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/concepts/locales/right-to-left-support/).

### Changed
- Charts on iOS devices will now automatically use lesser resolution to work around canvas memory restriction introduced in iOS 15 Safari.
- Charts will now use less built-in layers, and thus less `<canvas>` elements by default, reducing memory consumption.
- All low/high-related settings and fields moved from `CandlestickSeries` to `XYSeries`. Sometimes it could be useful to have low/high on other series even if they are not shown visually.

### Fixed
- `XYCursor` was not being hidden when its `positionX` or `positionY` was changed to `undefined` and `alwaysShow` was set to `false`.
- Auto-wrapped right-aligned labels were being rendered in wrong position.
- Auto-wrapped labels were not being trimmed for whitespace on each line.
- `dropFromPrevious` and `riseFromPrevious` states on `ColumnSeries` were not working properly on a column after a gap in data in case previous data item was outside of selection.
- Emoji characters were not being displayed on circular labels.


## [5.1.0] - 2022-01-20

### Added
- New `Root` setting: `timezone`. E.g. `"America/Vancouver"`, `"Australia/Sydney"`, `"UTC"`.
- New export CSV option: `addBOM` (default: `true`). Indicates whether to add BOM characters at start of CSV output so that data viewer (e.g. Excel) knows we're exporting UTF-8 data.
- New methods for `Adapters`: `remove(key)`, `disable(key)`, and `enable(key)`.
- `GaplessDateAxis` added. It's a version of `DateAxis` that removes data-less intervals from its scale. `CategoryAxis` is being deprecated in favor of `GaplessDateAxis`. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/charts/xy-chart/axes/gapless-date-axis/).
- Timezone support added. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/getting-started/root-element/#Time_zone).
- New `Component` method: `markDirtyValues()`. Will re-evaluate elements of the component that are data-reliant, such as axis labels.

### Fixed
- Clearing axis ranges from Axis and Series was not working properly.
- Slice with negative arc was ignoring `cornerRadius` property.
- `groupDataDisabled` on `XYSeries` was not working if set to `true`.
- Axis header was not updating its position if axes were stacked and size of an axis was updated.
- Disposing of charts with a lot of elements was quite slow.
- Series stacks with all-zero values could cause all stacks to disappear on zoom.


## [5.0.21] - 2022-01-11

### Added
- New `Sprite` setting: `forceInactive`. If set to `true`, it will override `interactive` setting as well as ignore any interaction events set on the element.
- `cursorhidden` event added to `XYCursor`. Dispatched when user rolls-out of the chart plot area and cursor is hidden.
- New `Component` method: `markDirtyValues()`. Forces a repaint of the element which relies on data.

### Changed
- Value (4th parameter of the Heat rule's `customFunction`) will now receive actual value of the target data item, not interpolated calculated setting value.

### Fixed
- Fixing bug when not passing the duration to the `animate` method ([Issue 181](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts5/issues/181)).
- Horizontal and vertical layouts with `width`/`height` set in percents plus `minWidth`/`minHeight`/`maxWidth`/`maxHeight` set were arranging items incorrectly.
- Very small slices with `cornrerRadius > 0` were being drawn as a full circle.
- `SliceGrouper` with was not zooming out properly if there was no legend in chart.
- changing `groupData` from `false` to `true` on DateAxis was not working when doing so after the chart was built.


## [5.0.20] - 2021-12-30

### Fixed
- `SliceGrouper` with `clickBehavior = "zoom"` was not zooming out properly.
- `GridLayout` could leave empty gaps if some of the items in it were hidden.
- dragging sprites within rotated containers was not working properly.
- Null value was breaking stacking of columns in some cases.
- Fixing tooltips being broken inside of shadow DOM. ([Issue 166](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts5/issues/166))


## [5.0.19] - 2021-12-27

### Added
- `groupDataDisabled` setting added to XYSeries. If set to `false` will exclude series from data grouping mechanism, even if it is enabled on related `DateSeries`.
- New plugin `SliceGrouper`. Can be used to automatically group small slices on percent charts like Pie, Funnel, etc. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/charts/percent-charts/grouping-slices/).

### Fixed
- If data was added to percent series after initial data was already processed, the bew slices would get colors from the start of the color set.
- Multiple square bracket and apostrophe escaping was not working properly.
- A JS error could occur when changing `XYSeries` data with less data items then there were before.
- `PieSeries` were not arranging its labels properly in some cases.
- `XYCursor` taps were not working properly after chart zoom on touch devices.


## [5.0.18] - 2021-12-19

### Changed
- When auto-wrapping labels, text will no longer break on dots to prevent fractional numbers from wrapping.
- Scrollable `Container`'s scrollbar will auto-hide if contents fit in it without scrolling.

### Fixed
- Disabling click-toggling of legend, was disabling hover events, too.
- `ResponsiveTheme`'s custom rules were not working properly.
- `Exporting` was not applying proper background color to exported images.
- `CategoryDateAxis` grid and labels placing algorithm improved.
- Sometimes bullets of XYChart were not being properly clipped by the bounds of the plot area.
- Memory leak related to: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1279394 was fixed.

- `WordCloud` was not showing anything if all words had the same weight.
- Adding `type` and `main` fields to `package.json`.
- Fixed scrollbar issue with non-animated theme where clicking on a background of a scrollbar would not move to target position.


## [5.0.16] - 2021-12-10

### Added
- `tooltipPositionX` and `tooltipPositionY` added to `XYSeries` (possible values: `"value"`, `"open"`, `"low"`, and `"high"`). Indicates which data item value tooltip should be anchored to.
- New settings added to `Exporting` for formatting durations: `durationFields`, `durationFormat`, and `durationUnit`.
- `showTooltipOn` (default: `"hover"`) added to `Sprite`. Another option is `"always"` which will show tooltip without any interaction with the element. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/concepts/common-elements/tooltips/#Sticky_tooltips).

### Changed
- `Hierarchy` will now set bottom-level node's `cursorOverStyle: "default"` via theme, instead of hardocding it, so that it can be overridden via node templates.

### Fixed
- Stacked `XYSeries` with missing values and `valueYShow` set to `"valueYTotalPercent"` or `valueXShow` set to `"valueXTotalPercent"` were not showing columns/lines.
- Changing legend position from bottom/top to right/left was not arranging elements properly.
- If `Slice` of a `PieSeries` had a `templateField` set, legend marker was not using all the settings of that slice properly.
- Bullets were causing performance issues when data grouping was turned on.
- `Label` underline was not inheriting label's color properly.
- `Label` underline was not beign placed properly on center/right-aligned labels.


## [5.0.15] - 2021-12-07

### Added
- Experimental support for underlined text added. Can be enabled via `Label` setting `fontDecoration: "underline"`, or via in-line style block (`[underline]`).
- Three new accessibility settings added: `ariaControls`, `ariaValueMin`, and `ariaValueMax`.

### Changed
- Focus elements used for accessibility are now enclosed in a container with `role="application"` which helps avoid "scan mode" in some screen readers.
- Tapping outside chart will now hide `XYCursor`.

### Fixed
- Sometimes `XYCursor` would stay on pointer moved out of chart area quickly.
- Fixed memory leak.
- Arabic text (and possibly other RTL languages) was not being displayed right on circular labels, even with `direction = "rtl"` set.
- Arabic text (`direction = "rtl"`) was being misplaced in tooltips.
- New line was resetting current in-line text style.


## [5.0.14] - 2021-12-01

### Changed
- When setting `markerState` on `Annotator` it will now automatically render annotations without the need to open annotation mode.

### Fixed
- Updating data dynamically on series in all-`ValueAxis` setups.
- Rmoving axis range was not working properly.
- Closing annotation mode would not make chart regain its interactivity.


## [5.0.13] - 2021-11-25

### Added
- `clickTarget` (possible vales: `"itemContainer"` (default), `"marker"`, and `"none"`) added to `Legend`. Use `clickTarget: "none"` to disable toggling of legend items.

### Changed
- Setting `wheelX`/`wheelY` on `XYChart` or `MapChart` no longer marks their plot areas as `wheelable`.

### Fixed
- In some cases using `oversizedBehavior = "wrap"` on labels in super small spaces the chart would hang.
- Updating data on a `ForcedDirectedTree` may cause JS errors.
- Hovering legend item of a hidden slice no longer tries to show the tooltip for it.

### Added
- `latitudeField` and `longitudeField` added to `MapPointSeries` for an easier way to add data.

### Changed
- Tooltip arrangement algorithm with many XY series was improved.

### Fixed
- Axis fill rule of `DateAxis` sometimes skipped an interval or was drawn two fills in a row. Also, with months as interval between grids, the end of the fill was not at exact position where it should have been.
- When setting new data for a series, if new data has less items than series had before, a JS error could occur.


## [5.0.11] - 2021-11-23

### Added
- New `fps` property on `Root` which defines the maximum FPS that it will run at. Set it 30 or lower if performance is an issue.
- `"range"` theme tag is now added to all axis range elements (axisFill, grid, tick and label) so you could target specific theme rules.
- `"range"` and `"series"` theme tag is now added to all series axis range elements (axisFill, grid, tick and label) so you could target specific theme rules.

### Changed
- A `axisFill` of an axis range will not be shown unless its `visible: true` setting is set.

### Fixed
- Adapter for `text` of a `Label` was not kicking in when data item of its `Tooltip` (or other parent of a Label) was changed.
- Legend marker/label was not returning to a default state when clicked on a disabled item in some cases when Animated theme was not used.
- Axis range fill tooltip was being shown in a wrong position.


## [5.0.10] - 2021-11-22

### Fixed
- `LineSeries`' strokes in an axis range were using wrong template, which could result incorrect colors or other settings (since 5.0.9).
- When data was updated on a live chart and the chart was not fully zoomed-out, some unnecessary Y axis animation used to happen after data update.


## [5.0.9] - 2021-11-22

### Changed
- `maxTooltipDistance` in `XYCursor` now accepts `-1` value, which means that only single tooltip will be shown, even if multiple data items share the same value.

### Fixed
- `GraticuleSeries` was broken.


## [5.0.8] - 2021-11-21

### Changed
- Trying to create a `Root` in a container that already contains a chart will result in a hard error now.
- All `XYSeries` now use both main template and axis range template (the latter has a priority) when decorating columns/lines/etc for the sections covered by axis range.

### Fixed
- Axis fills were not working properly.
- Since 5.0.6: Map was zoomed to incorrect position in some specific cases when `goHome()` method was called.


## [5.0.7] - 2021-11-19

### Added
- New setting `pan` (default: `"none"`) added to `AxisRendererX` and `AxisRendererY`. If set to `"zoom"` will enable zoom of axis scale by dragging in axis label area.

### Changed
- Heat rules will not longer apply setting value if target data item does not have any numeric value.
- Hovering legend item will now simulate hover on related item on some charts (e.g. `PieSeries`, `Hierarchy`, `Venn`).

###
- `HeatLegend` was acting out when its `showValue()` method was called with non-numeric parameter.
- If series was pre-hidden before chart init, its status was not being correctly reflected in related legend item.
- Locales in script version were not working properly.


## [5.0.6] - 2021-11-18

### Added
- Accessibility: new setting on `Sprite`: `focusableGroup`. If set, TAB key will iterate through first elements of each focusable group, allowing user to select within group using arrow keys. [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/concepts/accessibility/#Grouping_focusable_elements).
- New `Root` setting: `autoResize` (default: `true`). If set to `false`, the chart will not automtically resize itself when width/height of its container change. Use `resize()` method to resize manually.
- New `Root` method: `resize()`. Resizes chart to fit container dimensions, if automatic resizing is disabled (`root.autoResize = false`).
- Global `am5.p0` shortcut function added which returns `Percent(0)`.
- All element will now have a read-only property `root` which holds their `Root` object.
- New `Sprite` events: `rightclick` and `middleclick`. Please note that adding `rightclick` event will not disable possible contextual menu on right-mouse click.
- New `XYCursor` setting: `snapToSeriesBy` (default: `"xy"`). Defines in which direction to look when searching for the nearest data item to snap to. Possible values: `"xy"` (default), `"x"`, and `"y"`.

### Changed
- If set `wheel` event will now fire even if `wheelable = false`. This allows capturing wheel events on elements without interfering with scroll of the document.

### Fixed
- `oversizedBehavior` on `Label` (still) was not handling `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` values properly (since `5.0.2`).
- Dynamically updating `geoJSON` on a `MapPolygonSeries` was not working properly in some cases.


## [5.0.5] - 2021-11-15

### Added
- New root element method: `moveDOM()` (accepts element id or reference as a parameter). Can be used to move whole chart to some other container within DOM.

### Fixed
- `ExportingMenu` was interfering with functionality of form elements on the same page (e.g. select).
- Fixed issues with text kerning with styling blocks mid-word.
- Animating values of `width`/`height` settings using percent values was not working properly.


## [5.0.4] - 2021-11-12

### Added
- `panstarted`, `panended`, and `wheelended` events added to `XYChart`.

### Fixed
- Fixed `RadarChart` issues when it was being created in hidden container.
- `XYCursor` and `snapToSeries` problems fixed: was not working with `ColumnSeries`, and was not working properly with stacked axes.
- Adding/changing data on a `DateAxis` with `groupData = true` was not working properly.
- If non-rounded dates were used in data, `XYCursor`'s tooltips were flickering while moving cursor over plot area.


## [5.0.3] - 2021-11-09

### Fixed
- Incorrect sizing of a label in a central `Sunburst` node.


## [5.0.2] - 2021-11-09

### Added
- `radius()` and `baseRadius()` methods added to `RadialLabel`. Return `radius`/`baseRadius` value in pixels, calculated based on all the other settings.
- Global function `am5.ready()` added. Accepts a function as a parameter, which is executed when DOM is ready.

### Changed

### Changed
- Bullets on a `ColumnSeries` are now positioned vertically relative to visible part of the column, not the whole column.


## [5.0.0-beta.33] - 2021-10-12

### Fixed

- In some cases tooltips were losing their background/outline unless Animated theme was enabled.
- In some cases tooltips for a hidden series were still showing.


## [5.0.0-beta.32] - 2021-10-08

### Changed

### Changed
- The way values of nodes in `Hierarchy` is counted updated to be consistent. There are two options now: a) set values on lowest nodes (no children) so that each node's value is a sum of all its descendants; b) set values for **each** node. Using any other approach might produce unpredictangle results.
- `colors` of the `PercentSeries`, `FlowNodes`, and `Hierarchy` will be reset every time new data is set.
