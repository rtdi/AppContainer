# Background of CI/CD

## History

With the dawn of Agile Software development the build, deploy and test must be executed way more often, it must be automated. This lead to Continuous Development/Contiuous Deployment ("CI/CD") pipelines [(_[1] Arachchi & Perera, 2018_)](#1).
These pipelines are deeply integrated with source control systems, today that translates to a git integration. Git is a distributed source control system for large projects, created for coordinating the Linux developments. As such it supports everything needed in large projects. Its main concept is to clone repositories, each developer works on his copy and when checking in the changed files, the code is merged [(_[2] Loeliger & McCullough, 2012_)](#2).
